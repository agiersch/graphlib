Little graphics library.
Copyright (c) 2007-2013, Arnaud Giersch <arnaud.giersch@iut-bm.univ-fcomte.fr>

This is a little library based on the Qt framework to write simple
programs with graphics in C++.

It is not designed to write "real" programs, but rather to write toy
programs in beginners programming courses.

See the examples and documentation (in French) for details.
