The only dependencies are Qt4 development files.  On Debian and
Ubuntu, install the packages libqt4-dev and qt4-qmake.

To use this library, just copy the two files DrawingWindow.h and
DrawingWindow.cpp in your project, and build your program.  See the
examples to find how to use qmake for the build process.

To generate the documentation, use doxygen with the command:
        doxygen Doxyfile
or simply run
        make -f install.mk generate
